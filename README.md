This project performs the transformation of digital images into different formats using custom methods in Python.
The original image is loaded and displayed, followed by its conversion to grayscale, applying a weighted formula that considers the intensity of each color channel (red, green, and blue).
Subsequently, the grayscale image is binarized based on a threshold value, resulting in a black-and-white version where pixels are represented only by the values 0 (black) and 255 (white).
